# Home Assistant Add-on: Tailscale

Tailscale is a zero config VPN, which installs on any device in minutes,
including your Home Assistant instance.

Create a secure network between your servers, computers, and cloud instances.
Even when separated by firewalls or subnets, Tailscale just works. Tailscale
manages firewall rules for you, and works from anywhere you are.

## Prerequisites

In order to use this add-on, you'll need a Tailscale account.

It is free to use for personal & hobby projects, up to 20 clients/devices on a
single user account. Sign up using your Google, Microsoft or GitHub account at
the following URL:

<https://login.tailscale.com/start>

You can also create an account during the add-on installation processes,
however, it is nice to know where you need to go later on.

## Installation

1. Click the Home Assistant My button below to open the add-on on your Home
   Assistant instance.

1. Click the "Install" button to install the add-on.
1. Start the "Tailscale" add-on.
1. Check the logs of the "Tailscale" add-on to see if everything went well.
1. Open the Web UI of the "Tailscale" add-on to complete authentication and
   couple your Home Assistant instance with your Tailscale account.
   **Note:** Some browsers don't work with this step. It is recommended to
   complete this step on a desktop or laptop computer using the Chrome browser.
1. Done!

## Configuration

This add-on has almost no additional configuration options for the
add-on itself.

However, when logging in to Tailscale, you can configure your Tailscale
network right from their interface.

The add-on exposes "Exit Node" capabilities that you can enable from your
Tailscale account. Additionally, if the Supervisor managed your network (
which is the default), the add-on will also advertise routes to your
subnet to Tailscale.

```yaml
tags:
  - tag:example-server
  - tag:homeassistant
```

### Option: `tags`

This option allows you to specify specific ACL tags for this Tailscale
instance. They need to start with `tag:`.
