# Home Assistant Add-on: Adguard-Tailscale

Tailscale is a zero config VPN, which installs on any device in minutes,
including your Home Assistant instance.

Create a secure network between your servers, computers, and cloud instances.
Even when separated by firewalls or subnets, Tailscale just works. Tailscale
manages firewall rules for you, and works from anywhere you are.

## Prerequisites

In order to use this add-on, you'll need a Tailscale account.

It is free to use for personal & hobby projects, up to 20 clients/devices on a
single user account. Sign up using your Google, Microsoft or GitHub account at
the following URL:

<https://login.tailscale.com/start>

Make sure to enable HTTPS support for your Tailscale otherwise the add-on
won't start. This option needs to be enabled in Tailscale DNS settings.

   **Note:** Some browsers don't work with this step. It is recommended to
   complete this step on a desktop or laptop computer using the Chrome browser.
1. Check the add-on logs to get your Tailscale Home Assistant domain.
1. Done!

## Configuration

This add-on has almost no additional configuration options for the
add-on itself.

However, when logging in to Tailscale, you can configure your Tailscale
network right from their interface.

The add-on exposes "Exit Node" capabilities that you can enable from your
Tailscale account. Additionally, if the Supervisor managed your network (
which is the default), the add-on will also advertise routes to your
subnet to Tailscale.

```yaml
tags:
  - tag:example
  - tag:homeassistant
```

### Option: `tags`

This option allows you to specify specific ACL tags for this Tailscale
instance. They need to start with `tag:`.

More information: <https://tailscale.com/kb/1068/acl-tags/>

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.
