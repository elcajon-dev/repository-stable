# Home Assistant Add-on: Adguard-Tailscale

## About

Tailscale is a zero config VPN, which installs on any device in minutes,
including your Home Assistant instance.

Create a secure network between your servers, computers, and cloud instances.
Even when separated by firewalls or subnets, Tailscale just works. Tailscale
manages firewall rules for you, and works from anywhere you are.

AdGuard Home is a network-wide ad-and-tracker blocking DNS server with parental
control (adult content blocking) capabilities. Its purpose is to let you
control your entire network and all your devices, and it does not require
using a client-side program.

This add-on combines both functionalities and allows you to set up AdGuard
with your Tailscale internal IP. This allows you to block traffic without
forwarding your subnets with Tailscale.
